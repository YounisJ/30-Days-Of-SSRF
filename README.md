# 30-Days-Of-SSRF

Why SSRF?
- ✅ High Impact: Can lead to internal network access, data exfiltration, or even Remote Code Execution (RCE) in cloud environments.
- ✅ Difficult to Detect: Many security scanners miss SSRF, making it a gold mine for manual testers.
- ✅ Big Bounty Rewards: SSRF often gets payouts between $5,000 - $50,000+ depending on impact (especially in AWS, GCP, and Azure environments).
- ✅ Cloud-Specific SSRF: AWS metadata SSRF (stealing AWS credentials via 169.254.169.254) is highly critical and very rare.
- ✅ Growing Attack Surface: With modern cloud and microservices, SSRF is becoming more common but remains underrated.

SSRF Bug Bounty Real-World Examples
1️⃣ Uber - $10,000+ Payout: Found SSRF that accessed internal services and AWS metadata.
2️⃣ Facebook - $40,000 Payout: Exploited GraphQL API SSRF to access internal infrastructure.
3️⃣ Tesla - $15,000 Payout: SSRF allowed attackers to scan internal services.

How to Master SSRF?
🔹 Learn Basic SSRF: Test different URL payloads (http://localhost, file://, dict://, gopher://, ftp://, etc.).
🔹 Master Blind SSRF: Trigger out-of-band (OOB) interactions using Burp Collaborator, interact.sh, or requestbin.
🔹 Exploit Cloud Metadata Services: AWS (169.254.169.254), GCP, and Azure APIs.
🔹 Target GraphQL, APIs, and PDF Renderers: Many modern web apps have SSRF-prone APIs.
🔹 Automate SSRF Testing: Use Burp Suite, ffuf, and custom scripts to fuzz URLs.

Experiment with FFUF to fuzz URL-based parameters for SSRF.
📌 Day 7: Review & Practice

Revise what you’ve learned.
Solve PortSwigger SSRF labs.
🗓️ Week 2: Advanced SSRF Techniques & Cloud Exploitation
🎯 Goal: Learn blind SSRF, bypass protections, and exploit cloud metadata services.

📌 Day 8: Blind SSRF (bSSRF) Basics

What is Blind SSRF? Why is it more dangerous?
Use Burp Collaborator & interact.sh to detect bSSRF.
Learn exfiltrating data via DNS/HTTP out-of-band (OOB) techniques.
📌 Day 9: Exploiting AWS, GCP & Azure Metadata Services

Learn cloud-based SSRF attacks:
AWS: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
Google Cloud: http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/
Azure: http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-01-01
Read HackerOne AWS SSRF reports ($30K+ payouts).
📌 Day 10: Testing for Cloud-Based SSRF

Use Postman & curl to test SSRF on metadata endpoints.
Learn stealing AWS IAM credentials via SSRF.
📌 Day 11: Bypassing SSRF Protections

Common SSRF filters (deny-list, regex, IP restrictions).
Bypass techniques:
DNS Rebinding (evil.com → 127.0.0.1).
Using IPv6 ([::] instead of localhost).
Using Alternate Encodings (0x7F000001 for 127.0.0.1).
📌 Day 12: Exploiting SSRF in GraphQL APIs

How GraphQL APIs expose SSRF vulnerabilities.
