What is SSRF?
SSRF is When we access internal server through a vulnareable prameter which is used to communicate to the microservices or api's

For example:
a web app sends the request with parameter:
"STOCKAPI = http://shop.com/product/stock/..."
now we can easily remove the website and put "localhost" to access internal server like:
"STOCKAPI = http://localhost/admin"

IMPACTS:
Internal network scanning (port scanning)
Remote code execution (RCE)
Application level DDOS attack
